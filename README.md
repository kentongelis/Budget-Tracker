# My Project

This project is an app that allows for people to input their paychecks and see how much money they should save, how much money they should spend on their needs, and how much money they can spend on their wants.
This is determined by the user picking an option between lenient, normal, and extreme that best describes their saving needs and can be changed at any time.

Users also have access to a forum which consists of budgeting tips in which they can post tips and learn from others ways to save money.
There is also an option to ask AI on ways they can save money.
